3. Brand Architecture (Final Locked Structure)

AI Engine	Yaksh	Intelligent validation & automation agent

Narrative:

GSTPilot is the command center.
Yaksh is the guardian ensuring accuracy and compliance.

4. Naming Usage Rules (Strict)
4.1 Correct Styling

Always use:

GSTPilot (not GST PILOT / gstpilot / GstPilot)

Yaksh (capital Y, no suffix)

Examples

✔ GSTPilot dashboard
✔ Powered by Yaksh

Avoid

❌ GST PILOT
❌ gstpilot
❌ Yaksha AI
❌ YakshBot
❌ GSTYaksh

Consistency is critical for brand recall.

5. In-Product UX Copy Guidelines

Yaksh should be used as a noun persona, not as a generic “AI”.

5.1 Recommended UI Messages

Use tone: professional, intelligent, non-gimmicky.

Validation

“Yaksh is validating your invoices…”

“Yaksh detected 3 GSTIN format errors.”

“Yaksh found duplicate invoice numbers.”

JSON Generation

“Yaksh generated GSTR-1 JSON successfully.”

“Yaksh is preparing filing-ready data…”

Recommendations

“Yaksh recommends reviewing tax calculation mismatch.”

“Yaksh suggests re-validating corrected data.”

Reminders

“Yaksh reminder sent to client.”

“Yaksh scheduled follow-up reminder.”

6. Brand Voice & Tone
6.1 Core Tone

Professional

Authoritative

Intelligent

Compliance-focused

Not playful or gimmicky

Writing Style

Use clear, confident language:

“Yaksh detected validation errors.”
Not:
“Hey! AI bot found some issues 😄”

7. Positioning Statement (Official)

Use this exact version in website, decks, proposals:

GSTPilot is an AI-powered GST filing management platform built for CA firms to automate validation, generate JSON, manage reminders, and track filing status — all from one command center.

8. Website & Domain Guidelines
8.1 Domain (Locked)

8.2 Recommended URL Structure

9. Product Module Naming Convention

All modules should be prefixed with GSTPilot:

Yaksh operates inside these modules silently.
